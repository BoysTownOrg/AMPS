This repository contains our pre-registration, stimuli, data, and analysis scripts.

The two data files (preDec10 and postDec10) reflect the addition of the post-recall
item identification task, and as such the files are formatted and processed for
analysis differently.

To reproduce the figures and analyse described in the manuscript, please run the
AnalyzeData.m script in MATLAB located in the Analysis folder.  This script
requires the gmregress function, which you can download from:
